# Branching Strategy Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the branching strategy to be followed in the repository for managing development, staging, and main branches. The purpose is to provide a clear and organized approach to collaborative development and release management.

## Branches

### 1. Main Branch

- **Name:** `main`
- **Purpose:** Represents the production-ready code.
- **Rules:**
  - Only stable and tested code should be merged into `main`.
  - Direct commits to `main` should be avoided. All changes should go through pull requests.

### 2. Development Branch

- **Name:** `development`
- **Purpose:** Represents the latest development changes.
- **Rules:**
  - Developers create feature branches from `development`.
  - Frequent integration with feature branches to identify and resolve conflicts early.

### 3. Feature Branches

- **Naming Convention:** `feature/<feature-name>`
- **Purpose:** Isolated branches for developing specific features.
- **Rules:**
  - Created from and merged back into `development`.
  - Short-lived and specific to a single feature or bug fix.
  - Regularly updated with changes from `development`.

### 4. Staging Branch

- **Name:** `staging`
- **Purpose:** Represents a stable state for testing before release.
- **Rules:**
  - Merged from `development` once a set of features are ready for testing.
  - Used for integration testing before merging into `main`.

## Workflow

1. **Feature Development:**
   - Create a new feature branch from `development`.
   - Implement and test the feature.
   - Regularly merge changes from `development` to stay up-to-date.

2. **Code Review:**
   - Create a pull request when the feature is ready.
   - Get code reviews from peers.
   - Make necessary changes and address feedback.

3. **Merge to Development:**
   - Once the feature is approved, merge it into the `development` branch.

4. **Testing:**
   - Periodically merge `development` into `staging` for testing.
   - Conduct thorough testing on the `staging` branch.

5. **Release to Production:**
   - After successful testing, merge `staging` into `main` for release.

## Best Practices

- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive.
- Regularly update local branches with remote changes.
- Avoid force-pushing to shared branches.
- Utilize git hooks for automation and validation.
